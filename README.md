# Environemntal Variables set up

- To be able to use and run the databases you will need to set up two environment files:
  .env.test, which should contain a variable (PGDATABASE= "test database name")
  .env.development, which contain a variable(PGDATABASE = "development database name)

- you can refer to the setup.sql file to see the names of the database.
